  abstract = {We examine a cascade encoding model for neural response in which a
	linear filtering stage is followed by a noisy, leaky, integrate-and-fire
	spike generation mechanism. This model provides a biophysically more
	realistic alternative to models based on Poisson (memoryless) spike
	generation, and can effectively reproduce a variety of spiking behaviors
	seen in vivo. We describe the maximum likelihood estimator for the
	model parameters, given only extracellular spike train responses
	(not intracellular voltage data). Specifically, we prove that the
	log-likelihood function is concave and thus has an essentially unique
	global maximum that can be found using gradient ascent techniques.
	We develop an efficient algorithm for computing the maximum likelihood
	solution, demonstrate the effectiveness of the resulting estimator
	with numerical simulations, and discuss a method of testing the model's
	validity using time-rescaling and density evolution techniques.},
